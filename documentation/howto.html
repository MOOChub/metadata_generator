<h2>How to</h2>
  <p style="display: compact">This tool was developed to support course creators and admins to generate metadata for their courses.
    It generates data fragments according to the MOOChub metadata format.</p>

  <p>The tool offers the option to search for competencies and fields of studies via the search bar. The search will
    consider all frameworks presented in the search limiters beneath the search bar. The search limiter can be used to
    display only data from a specific framework.</p>

  <p>The second option is to explore the frameworks directly.The user can choose a framework via the dropdown menu. The
    user can select the desired field of study or skill by expending the framework tree and pick the entries by checking
    the respective checkboxes.</p>

  <p>The selected entries appear directly in the "Selected Entries" section on the right side. Unselecting the
    respective checkbox removes the entry. The list in the "Selected Entries" section will be used for the
    generation of the metadata fragment(s).</p>

  <p>By clicking the "Write JSON" button the metadata fragment(s) will be generated and can be downloaded. Important:
    fields of study and skills are saved in separate JSON files. The download itself will return a ZIP file.</p>

  <p>The list can be completely cleared by pressing the "Reset" button.</p>
