<h2>How to</h2>
  <p>This tool was developed to support course creators and admins to generate metadata for their courses. It generates
  data fragments according to the MOOChub metadata format.</p>

  <p>The user can choose a framework via the dropdown menu. The user can select the desired field of study or skill
  by expending the framework tree and pick the entries by checking the respective checkboxes.</p>

  <p>The selected entries appear directly in the "Selected Entries" section on the right side. Unselecting the
  respective checkbox directly removes the entry. The list in the "Selected Entries" section will be used for the
  generation of the metadata fragment(s).</p>

  <p>By clicking the "Write JSON" button the metadata fragment(s) will be generated and can be downloaded. Important:
  fields of study and skills are saved in separate JSON files.</p>

  <p>The list can be completely cleared by pressing the "Reset" button.</p>
